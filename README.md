Data Science - Apriori Algorithm in Python- Market Basket Analysis
Data Science Apriori algorithm is a data mining technique that is used for mining frequent item sets and relevant association rules. This module highlights what association rule mining and Apriori algorithms are, and the use of an Apriori algorithm. Also, we will build one Apriori model with the help of the Python programming language in a small business scenario. However, it has some limitations, which you can minimize through various methods. The algorithm is used in different sectors for data mining and pattern recognition.
